## Firebase Setup (If Not Done)

### Enable Authentication Providers

- Enable toggle
- Save

#### Anonymous
- Click "Anonymous"
- Enable toggle
- Save

#### Google Sign-In
- Click "Google"
- Enable toggle
- Add support email
- Save

**For Android:**
- Add SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints:
```bash
cd vibebase_app/android
./gradlew signingReport
```
- Copy SHA-1 and SHA-256 from `:app:debug` output
- Go to Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings â†’ Your apps â†’ Android app
- Add fingerprints

**For Web:**
- No additional setup needed

#### Apple Sign-In (iOS Only)
- Click "Apple"
- Enable toggle
- Save

**iOS Setup:**
1. Open Xcode
2. Select project â†’ Signing & Capabilities
3. Add "Sign in with Apple" capability

**Apple Developer Portal:**

## Common Issues

### Issue: "No Firebase App has been created"
**Solution:** Firebase initialization failed
```bash
cd vibebase_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Issue: Google Sign-In not working on Android
**Solution:** Add SHA fingerprints to Firebase Console
```bash
cd vibebase_app/android
./gradlew signingReport
# Copy SHA-1 and SHA-256 to Firebase Console
```

### Issue: Compile errors with "Undefined name 'authServiceProvider'"
**Solution:** Run build_runner again
```bash
cd vibebase_app
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Issue: Policy links show error
**Solution:** Policy URLs are placeholders
- Update URLs in `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` (line 145)
- Update URLs in `lib/widgets/auth/register_screen.dart` (line 79)
- Or host policies and update URLs

### Issue: Apple Sign-In doesn't show on Android
**This is expected behavior.** Apple Sign-In only appears on iOS devices.

### Issue: Google logo missing
**This is expected.** The code has a graceful fallback showing an icon + text button.

## Hot Reload Tips

- **r**: Hot reload (applies code changes instantly)
- **R**: Hot restart (full restart)
- **q**: Quit app

When editing:
- UI changes â†’ Use **r** (hot reload)
- State/logic changes â†’ Use **R** (hot restart)
- Provider changes â†’ Stop app, run build_runner, restart app
