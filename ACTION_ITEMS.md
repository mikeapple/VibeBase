# VibeBase - Action Items

This document tracks what has been done and what needs to be completed to get VibeBase fully operational.

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Project Structure
- [x] Created Flutter project with Android, iOS, and Web support
- [x] Set up folder structure (models, services, screens, widgets, utils)
- [x] Created Firebase configuration files (firestore.rules, storage.rules, firebase.json)
- [x] Created .gitignore with appropriate exclusions

### Scripts
- [x] Created `setup.sh` - Automated setup script for dependencies
- [x] Created `configure_firebase.sh` - Firebase configuration script
- [x] Created `deploy.sh` - Deployment script for all platforms

### Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- [x] Created `README.md` with quick start instructions
- [x] Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project context

### Code Templates
- [x] Created `AuthService` - Firebase Authentication service
- [x] Created `FirestoreService` - Firestore database service
- [x] Created `UserModel` - User data model
- [x] Created validation utilities
- [x] Created app constants
- [x] Updated `main.dart` with Firebase initialization structure

## üîÑ Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Run Interactive Setup Wizard
```bash
./setup.sh
```
The wizard will:
- Collect your app name, organization ID, and description
- Rename `vibebase_app` to `your_app_name_app`
- Update all configuration files (pubspec.yaml, AndroidManifest.xml, Info.plist, etc.)
- Update bundle identifiers for all platforms
- Install Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI
- Add all Firebase dependencies to the project
- Generate PROJECT_INFO.md with your project details

### 2. Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project" or select existing one
3. Follow the wizard
4. **Note your Project ID** - you'll need it for the next step

### 3. Configure Firebase
```bash
./configure_firebase.sh
```
When prompted, enter your Firebase Project ID. This will:
- Connect your app to Firebase
- Generate `firebase_options.dart` file
- Configure Firebase for Android, iOS, and Web

### 4. Enable Firebase Services

In the Firebase Console, enable:

#### Authentication
- Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
- Enable Email/Password
- (Optional) Enable Google Sign-In
- (Optional) Enable Apple Sign-In for iOS

#### Firestore Database
- Navigate to Firestore Database
- Click "Create database"
- Start in Test mode (for development)
- Choose your preferred location

#### Storage (Optional)
- Navigate to Storage
- Click "Get started"
- Start in Test mode (for development)

### 5. Deploy Security Rules
After setting up Firestore and Storage:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

### 6. Test the Application

#### Web
```bash
cd vibebase_app
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### Android
```bash
cd vibebase_app
flutter run -d android
```

#### iOS
```bash
cd vibebase_app
flutter run -d ios
```

## üìã Future Development Tasks

### Authentication UI
- [ ] Create login screen
- [ ] Create signup screen
- [ ] Create password reset screen
- [ ] Create profile screen
- [ ] Add authentication state management (Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc)

### App Features
- [ ] Define core features for VibeBase
- [ ] Create corresponding screens and widgets
- [ ] Implement navigation (e.g., using go_router)
- [ ] Add state management solution

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for services
- [ ] Write widget tests for UI components
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

### CI/CD
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- [ ] Configure automated deployments
- [ ] Set up version management

### Additional Services
- [ ] Implement push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement error logging (e.g., Crashlytics)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Platform-Specific
- [ ] Configure app icons and splash screens
- [ ] Set up deep linking
- [ ] Configure Android signing for release
- [ ] Configure iOS certificates and provisioning profiles

## üêõ Known Issues

- Firebase packages will show import errors until `setup.sh` and `configure_firebase.sh` are run
- `firebase_options.dart` doesn't exist yet - created after running `configure_firebase.sh`

## üìù Notes

- All scripts are executable and located in the project root
- Firebase configuration files are ready but not deployed until you run the deployment command
- Security rules in `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` are templates - customize for your needs
- The current `main.dart` is a placeholder - replace with your app's home screen once you define features
